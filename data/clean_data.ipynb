    "# Data Cleaning and Unification Script Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed to unify two datasets: S\\&P 500 historical price data and gold historical price data. It processes the raw data, fills in gaps for gold prices (where only yearly averages are available), and creates a single unified CSV file with corresponding S\\&P 500 and gold prices. This output is ready for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets were sourced from the following:\n",
    "1. **S\\&P 500 Data**: Retrieved from [multpl.com](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices), which provides historical monthly prices for the index.\n",
    "2. **Gold Data**: Compiled from two sources:\n",
    "    * [Historic Gold Prices 1833-Present (National Mining Association)](https://nma.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/historic_gold_prices_1833_pres.pdf)\n",
    "    * Modern gold price data from Yahoo Finance (symbol: GC=F).\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation explains how the code processes, merges, and handles missing data in these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Input**\n",
    "    * **S\\&P 500 File** (sp500.csv): Contains columns Date (in MM/DD/YYYY format) and Value (formatted as strings with commas, e.g., \"5,917.02\").\n",
    "    * **Gold File** (gold.csv): Contains columns Date (which may be either a year or a specific MM/DD/YYYY date) and Value (price in numeric format).\n",
    "2. **Data Processing**\n",
    "    * **S\\&P 500 Data**:\n",
    "        * Parses dates into datetime.date objects.\n",
    "        * Converts price values to float, removing commas.\n",
    "        * Creates a dictionary {date: price} for efficient lookups.\n",
    "    * **Gold Data**:\n",
    "        * Parses the Date column:\n",
    "        * If the value is a year (e.g., 1833), it treats the price as the annual average and assigns it to all months within that year (January–December).\n",
    "        * If the value is a specific date (MM/DD/YYYY), it associates the exact date with the price.\n",
    "        * Handles yearly averages by creating placeholder entries for the 1st day of each month within the year if specific monthly/daily data is missing.\n",
    "        * Creates a dictionary {date: price} where date is a datetime.date object.\n",
    "3. **Merging Data**\n",
    "    * For each date in the S\\&P 500 data, the script:\n",
    "    * Attempts to find a matching gold price for the exact date.\n",
    "    * If no exact match exists, it defaults to the 1st of the month, or falls back to the year average.\n",
    "    * Produces a unified dataset with the structure: `Date,SP500,Gold`\n",
    "4. **Output**\n",
    "    * Writes the unified data to a CSV file (unified\\_data.csv).\n",
    "    * Dates are formatted as MM/DD/YYYY, and prices are represented as floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare your datasets in the following formats:\n",
    "    * **S\\&P 500 Data**: A CSV file named sp500.csv with columns Date and Value.\n",
    "    * **Gold Data**: A CSV file named gold.csv with columns Date and Value.\n",
    "    * The Date column may include years (e.g., 1833) or full dates (MM/DD/YYYY).\n",
    "    * Ensure all prices are numerical or strings that can be converted to floats.\n",
    "2. Place the script and the input files (sp500.csv and gold.csv) in the same directory.\n",
    "3. Run the script. The output will be saved as unified\\_data.csv.\n",
    "4. Examine the unified CSV for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions and Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fallback Logic**:\n",
    "    * Gold prices default to the 1st of the month if no specific date is available.\n",
    "    * If no monthly data is available, it defaults to the annual average.\n",
    "* **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "    * The script removes commas from numerical values and skips invalid rows (e.g., missing or unparsable dates/values).\n",
    "* **Granularity**:\n",
    "    * The unified dataset retains daily granularity where available but gracefully handles missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recreating the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like to recreate the data yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **S\\&P 500 Historical Data**: Download from [multpl.com](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices).\n",
    "* **Gold Historical Data**:\n",
    "    * Use the PDF provided by the [National Mining Association](https://nma.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/historic_gold_prices_1833_pres.pdf) for historical averages.\n",
    "    * Retrieve recent gold prices from Yahoo Finance (GC=F symbol) or another financial data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow a similar approach to process and merge the data into a unified format."
