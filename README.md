# FinancialRocket ðŸš€

FinancialRocket is an offline web application designed to help users simulate and visualize their journey to financial independence. Inspired by [the metaphor of breaking free from "financial gravity,"](https://dylanwheeler.net/writing/your-financial-rocket-a-guide-to-reaching-escape-velocity) this tool models your portfolio growth, expenses, and inflation over time to show when you'll reach "escape velocity"â€”the point where your investments grow faster than your expenses.

## Why FinancialRocket?

Imagine your life as a rocket ready to launch. Every dollar you've saved is fuel, every expense is gravity, and compound growth is the engine that propels you forward. FinancialRocket was created to empower users to understand their financial trajectories, experiment with scenarios, and visualize the impact of their decisions in an engaging and inspiring way.

This tool is more than just numbersâ€”itâ€™s about reclaiming time, pursuing dreams, and designing a life of freedom and creativity.

## Features

- **Offline:** Runs entirely in your browser with no internet required.
- **Historical Data Integration:** Models portfolio growth using historical S&P 500 data, gold prices for inflation, and realistic compounding scenarios.
- **Custom Scenarios:** Configure portfolio size, expenses, income contributions, and more to simulate various financial paths.
- **Interactive Projections:** Explore year-by-year breakdowns of your financial journey, complete with monthly details.
- **Rocket Animation:** Watch your financial rocket take off, showing the sustainability of your financial trajectory.
